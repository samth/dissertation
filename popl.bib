                  parallel implementation of applications that perform both
                  symbolic and scientific computations. Unlike previous
                  languages, FX uses an effect system to discover expression
                  scheduling constraints. The effect system is part of a
                  kinded type system with three base kinds: types, which
                  describe the value of an expression: effects, which
                  describe the side-effects that an expression may have; and
                  regions, which describe the areas of the store in which
                  side-effects may occur. Types, effects, and regions are
                  collectively descriptions. FX expressions can be abstracted
                  over any kind of description. This permits type, effect,
                  and region polymorphism. Unobservable side-effects are
                  masked by the effect system; an effect soundness property
                  guarantees that the effects computed statically by the
                  effect system are a conservative approximation of the
                  actual side-effects that a given expression may have.
                  Effect polymorphism and effect masking make the FX effect
                  system substantially more powerful than previous approaches
                  to side-effect analysis."

                 performed during application development for many
                 systems, especially safety-critical and
                 mission-critical systems. The V\&V process is intended
                 to discover errors, especially errors related to
                 critical processing, as early as possible during the
                 development process. The system application provides
                 the context under which the software artifacts are
                 validated. This paper describes a framework that
                 extends V\&V from an individual application system to a
                 product line of systems that are developed within an
                 architecture-based software engineering environment.
                 This framework includes the activities of traditional
                 application-level V\&V, and extends these activities
                 into domain engineering and into the transition between
                 domain engineering and application engineering. The
                 framework includes descriptions of the types of
                 activities to be performed during each of the
                 life-cycle phases, and provides motivation for the

  abstract =     "Software reuse is being pursued in an attempt to
		  improve programmer productivity. The concept of reuse
		  is to permit various work products of software
		  development to be used on more than one project in
		  order to amortize their development costs. Productivity
		  is not the only advantage of reuse although it is the
		  most widely publicized. By incorporating reusable
		  components into a new product, the components bring
		  with them whatever qualities they possess, and these
		  can contribute to the quality of the new product. This
		  suggests that reuse might be exploited for achieving
		  quality as an entirely separate goal from improving
		  productivity. If useful properties pertaining to
		  quality could be shown to be present in products as a
		  direct result of software development based on reuse,
		  this might be a cost-effective way of achieving those
		  qualities irrespective of the productivity advantages.
		  The adjective certified is sometimes used to describe
		  components that have been tested in some way prior to
		  entry into a library but the term certified is not
		  formally defined in the reuse literature. In this
		  paper, we address the issue of certifying reusable
		  components. We advocate the development of software by
		  reuse with the specific intent of establishing as many
		  of the required properties in the final product as
		  possible by depending upon properties present in the
		  reusable components. For this goal to succeed, a
		  precise definition of certification of reusable
		  components is required and such a definition is
		  presented. The benefits of the definition and the way
		  in which it supports the goal are explored.",

  abstract="
    Twenty years ago Abelson and Sussman's \emph{Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs} radically changed the
    intellectual landscape of introductory computing courses. Instead
    of teaching some currently fashionable programming language, it
    employed Scheme and functional programming to teach important
    ideas. Introductory courses based on the book showed up around the
    world and made Scheme and functional programming
    popular. Unfortunately, these courses quickly disappeared again
    due to shortcomings of the book and the whimsies of Scheme. Worse,
    the experiment left people with a bad impression of Scheme and
    functional programming in general. In this pearl, we propose an
    alternative role for functional programming in the first-year
    curriculum. Specifically, we present a framework for discussing
    the first-year curriculum and, based on it, the design rationale
    for our book and course, dubbed \emph{How to Design Programs}. The
    approach emphasizes the systematic design of programs. Experience
    shows that it works extremely well as a preparation for a course
    on object-oriented programming."}

                      use of type information handled through mechanical typechecking

                      of the language it is embedded in; it adapts equally well to 
                      functional, imperative, object-oriented, and algebraic programming, 
                      and it is not incompatible with relational and concurrent programming. 
                      The main purpose of this paper is to show how typeful programming is 
                      best supported by sophisticated type systems, and how these systems 
                      can help in clarifying programming issues and in adding power and
